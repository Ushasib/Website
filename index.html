						<p>I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in the 
                        <a href="https://ling.yale.edu/">Department of Linguistics at Yale University</a>. I'm interested in language variations and universalities, and my approach is based on formal semantics, pragmatics and syntactic theories using fieldwork methodologies.

  			  <h3><b>Definiteness</b></h3>
  			  <p>My current research and dissertation (on-going) expands the current understanding of nominal systems in languages across the world, specifically with regards to kind reference and definiteness expressions. I empirically focus on three indigenous and understudied languages spoken in the North East Region of India - Khasi, Mizo, and Mongsen Ao, bringing my data through semantic fieldwork: (mostly) on site and virtual. These languages exhibit unique properties that update typologies of the mapping between morphosyntax and semantics of bare nouns (kinds vs predicates), definite and demonstrative expressions. Broadly, these claims broaden our perspectives on universalities in grammar.  
  			  	<br/>
           <br/>
           I have priorly worked, jointly with Ka-Fai Yip and Margaret Chui Yi Lee, on the typology of definiteness in Cantonese and Bangla. We motivate an integration of (quasi-)names (such as English mum) to the existing typology, arguing that unique bare nominals in bare classifier languages are in fact (quasi-)names rather than regular definite descriptions.
  			 <br/>
  			  <h3><b>Counting and classifiers</b></h3>
  			  As an extension of my second qualifying paper, I have been working on counting strategies in various languages of the world, Khasi, Mandarin, Dene Suline, Yoruba, among others. Recently, I have presented work that proposes that (at least numeral) classifiers exist universally in languages drawing primary data from Khasi which exhibits obligatory co-occurrence of classifiers and plural markers. While classifiers exist universally, their forms are determined by parametric variation of bare noun denotation and morphosyntactic rules such as Fusion. This will remain to be an on-going project as I bring more languages and other types of classifiers into the picture. My immediate attention is on languages with optional classifiers, such as Turkish or Hungarian among others.
